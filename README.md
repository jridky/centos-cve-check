### Installation
Fill bugzilla credentials into `bugzilla.conf` file first.
Fill MySQL credentials into `database.conf` if you would like to run this script as web service. This assumes, you have installed MySQL (MariaDB) database and you have created database and table as available in `dbinit.sql` file.

Run `setup.sh` script as `root`.

### Usage
`python3 check.py -l NVR`

WARNING: Without `-l` option script will try to communicate with MySQL database. To avoid this, you have to use `-l` option.

Based on return value:
- 0 = Allow
- 1 = Deny
- 2 = Deny due of error (no valid NVR passed)

Standard output will contain NVR of the newest safe build, that can be shipped in CentOS stream.
